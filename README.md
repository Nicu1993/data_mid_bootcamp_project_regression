Welcome to our real estate data analysis project! In this project, we set out to predict the selling prices of houses based on a variety of features using advanced machine learning techniques. Here's an overview of what we did and what you can expect in our project:

Data Exploration:
We thoroughly explored the dataset containing information on 22,000 properties sold between May 2014 and May 2015. Our initial steps included using the "describe" method to get a summary of numerical features and checking for missing values. We also used Matplotlib and Seaborn to create insightful visualizations, gaining a deeper understanding of the data distribution and feature correlations.
Data Pre-processing:
To prepare the data for modeling, we handled categorical variables using one-hot encoding and label encoding, as needed. Additionally, we scaled the numerical variables to ensure they were on similar scales, which is essential for better model performance.
Building Predictive Models:
Since our objective was to predict house prices, we utilized various regression models. We split the dataset into training and testing sets to train and evaluate the models' performances. Our model selection included tried-and-tested algorithms like linear regression, K-nearest neighbors (KNN), and decision trees. We compared their accuracies using mean squared error or mean absolute error as our benchmark.
Model Evaluation:
After building the predictive models, we carefully evaluated their performance to find the best fit for the data. This step helped us choose the most accurate model that would help us predict house prices effectively.
Tableau Visualization:
To delve deeper into the dataset and uncover valuable insights, we turned to Tableau for data visualization. Creating interactive dashboards and visualizations, we addressed specific questions about the dataset. Our Tableau analysis covered areas such as the impact of waterfront views on house prices, the relationship between property condition and selling price, and how house grade affects property values.
By combining our machine learning predictions with Tableau's visualizations, we were able to explore the spatial distribution of high-value properties ($650K and above) on a map and identify any patterns or trends in property prices over time.

Conclusion:
Our real estate data analysis project provides a comprehensive understanding of the factors influencing house prices and identifies the key characteristics of higher-valued properties. With this valuable knowledge, our real estate company can make informed decisions and gain a competitive edge in the market. We invite you to explore the results of our project and discover the insights that will help shape the future of the housing market.
